## Challenge Prompt

So.... bad news.
We got hit with ransomware.
And... worse news... we paid the ransom.
	 
_After_ the breach we FINALLY set up _some_ sort of backup solution... it's not that good, but, it might save our bacon... because my VM crashed while I was trying to decrypt everything.

And perhaps the worst news... **I forgot the decryption key.**

_Gosh, I have such bad memory!!_
