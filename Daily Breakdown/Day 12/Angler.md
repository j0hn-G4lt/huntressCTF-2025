My sea is made of data, my shore a glowing screen, I cast my line with careful code, in a vast and global scene.
My lure is not a worm or fly, but a name you trust, a prize, My hook is hid within a link, disguised before your eyes.
I do not fish for flesh or fin, but for a private key, reeling in the secrets you mistakenly give to me.
Send to that which is found within the above, to the destination you have yet to reveal, and the secret you seek will reveal.
